</p>
<p>
For my first line of action, I will create the Head Administrator role by navigating to the Admin Panel > Agents > Roles, this step ensures that management will be able to oversee and correct any outstanding issues
</p>
<br />

<p>
<h2>Creating Departments</h2>

<p>
<h2>Creating Agents and Teams</h2>

</p>
<p>
Level I Support will be responsible for simple tasks such as password resets or general information. 

Deep issues in the infrastructure of the website will be escalated to Level II Support for their evaluation.

For my Head Administrator I will create Marlon Robinson , and Dominic Clark as my Level I support (names used for demo purposes do not reflect real people)


<p>
<h2>Configuring SLA (Service Level Agreement)</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Next i'll configure SLA levels, with SEV-A being the most urgent usually used in cases of widespread service disruption, SEV-B will be utilized for deeper issues on a smaller scale, SEV-C will be used for everything else.
</p>
<h2>Help Topics</h2>
<br />

</p>
Help topics are used to guide what information is gathered from Users and how tickets are routed or assigned

- Now with all of these steps, the Rainbow Help Desk is prepared to take incoming requests from clients
